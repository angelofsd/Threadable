      <p>As an anonymous (or more privileged) user, I want the ability to browse today's ten most popular posts on the front page of the site. 
                    A post's popularity is the total of its upvotes minus its downvotes. A post is considered one of "today's posts" if it was posted or 
                    replied to in the last 24 hours.</p>
